        <p>The clock struck twelve at Station 9, but no trains were scheduled. Jake, the night guard, paced the empty platform—his flashlight beam cutting through fog so thick it swallowed his own footsteps.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the station lights dimmed. The announcement system crackled to life in a voice that sounded decades old: “Next train arriving at 12:01 AM.” Heart pounding, Jake peered down the track, but the rails were empty.</p>
        <p>At exactly 12:01 AM, a train appeared from nowhere. Its windows glowed with a pale, greenish light. Doors hissed open, revealing carriages filled with silent passengers whose eyes reflected the ghostly glow. Jake stepped forward. “Ticket, please,” the conductor whispered.</p>
        <p>Jake searched his pockets—no ticket. Suddenly, the passengers turned toward him, faces blank and eyes distant. The train started to move. He tried to run, but his legs felt rooted to the platform. The train vanished as quickly as it appeared, leaving Jake alone in the darkness, wondering if he had dreamt it all.</p>
        <p>He glanced at his watch—12:00 AM. The announcement whispered again, “Next train at 12:01 AM.” Every night thereafter, Jake waited… but the train never came back. Or so he thought… until one fateful midnight when he heard the whistle again.</p>`

        <p>One evening, she found the key taped under a dusty bookshelf. Heart hammering, she crept up the creaking stairs and inserted the key into the lock. The door swung open onto a room frozen in time: an old cot, a rocking chair still swaying, and portraits on the walls whose eyes seemed to follow her.</p>
        <p>As Sarah stepped inside, the door slammed shut. A whisper echoed: “Why have you come?” She spun around—no one there. Suddenly, a hand reached for hers from the rocking chair. She gasped and saw a pale child’s face, eyes brimming with sorrow.</p>
        <p>“Help me,” the child whispered. Sarah didn’t know who the child was or why they were trapped. But as she reached out, the room dissolved into darkness. When morning came, Sarah woke on the staircase. The door upstairs was gone—and in its place was a single portrait of a grieving family, the eyes filled with silent questions.</p>`

        <p>He walked room to room, each empty chair echoing the past. In the attic, he found his old journal, its pages yellowed and brittle. Every word he wrote as a boy—dreams, fears, confessions—came flooding back. But on the last page was a single phrase he didn’t remember writing: “Forgive me.”</p>
        <p>Suddenly, a creak behind him. He turned to see the shadow of someone moving across the wooden floor. His sister’s laugh—he thought it was gone forever—whispered in his ear. The lights flickered. He dropped the journal and fled the attic.</p>
        <p>Outside, in the golden dusk, he realized some echoes of the past never truly vanish. They linger to remind us of who we were—and what we need to forgive.</p>`

        <p>Anna, Crowley’s granddaughter, inherited the shop. She wound the handless clock out of curiosity. As gears turned, a hidden drawer popped open, revealing a faded map and a journal detailing a lost artifact said to control time itself.</p>
        <p>Anna embarked on a quest across centuries-old libraries and hidden tunnels. Every clue led her closer to an underground vault, where a glowing hourglass sat atop a stone pedestal. Just as she reached for it, the ground trembled. The townspeople had followed her, hungry for power. Anna realized the artifact’s danger: if misused, time could collapse.</p>
        <p>With courage, she smashed the hourglass. The vault’s walls rattled, but the artifact shattered into grains of sand. Anna emerged into daylight, knowing Crowley’s legacy wasn’t a tool to control time, but a lesson: time’s true meaning lies in moments we cherish—before they slip away forever.</p>`
